1. What command(s) do you use to run [MariaDB](https://hub.docker.com/_/mariadb)
   in Docker on your machine and map its port to the port `12345` on your
   machine? It should contain a database called `prework`.

3. How do you run step 1 but use `init.sql` to
   initialize the database?

4. What command do you use to open bash console in your running MariaDB
   container?

5. What commands do you use to list containers, list images, stop a container,
   start a container, remove a container?

6. In `server.py` you have a small Python server
   implementation. Please create a custom Docker image around it and a Docker
   compose that starts up this server and the MariaDB container from the steps
   above. The server should connect to the MariaDB container and it should
   expose its HTTP port to localhost's port 8082. How do you check that
   the server works? Note that the server has requirements that must be
   installed with `pip install -r requirements.txt`
