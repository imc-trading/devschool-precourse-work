# Python

You will need a solid grasp of the fundamentals of Python before starting Dev
School. We will work through more advanced features of the language but expect
you to be able to code to a basic level already. If you can complete the
attached exercise then you will be at a comfortable level to begin the school.

## Resources
### Recommended Exercises

Write code! The best way to get better at a programming language is by writing
code.

One way to do this is through Code Katas. There are many lists of Code Katas
online. Here is one:
