# Kubernetes + Helm exam

:::{admonition} Instructions
Create a Helm chart for the `pod-info-app` application from the K8s pre-work. For the most part this entails copying into
the Helm chart's `templates` directory the K8s YAML files you created in the K8s pre-work. Moreover, you'll need to make
some things configurable there.

Zip the Helm chart and send it to
[Dev School Leads](mailto:Development%20School%20Leads%20%3Cdevschoolleads%40imc%2Ecom%3E?subject=Pre%2Dwork%20K8s%20helm%20exam%20submission)
(devschoolleads@imc.com) with the subject "Pre-work K8s Helm exam submission".
:::

Requirements:

* Use the `exam` namespace.
* Have a deployment that creates a number of replicas for the `pod-info-app` pods. Make the **number of replicas
  configurable** in `values.yaml` with the key `replicaCount`.
* Add a service. Make the external port configurable with the key `externalPort`.
* Have a `debug` value in `values.yaml`. If `debug: "true"` your chart should deploy a `busybox` deployment.
* Make the name of the deployments end with the version of the chart.
