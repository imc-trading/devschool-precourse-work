# C++ Sanitizers & Settings

Programming is hard and error-prone, and we need all the help that we can get. Luckily, there are tools to help us catch mistakes as early as possible.

## Compiler warnings

The compiler can warn us when it detects potentially harmful/buggy constructs being used in our code. These warnings are controlled by passing flags (such as -Wall) to the compiler. 

At IMC, we treat all warnings as errors: Compilation will fail if any warning is reported!

Warnings are enabled by adding a flag to the compile command. In Bazel we can add global warnings in our `WORKSPACE` file, where we configure our `imc_cc_toolchain`, by adding them as a `copt` or adding a copts argument directly to a rule:
```python
imc_cc_toolchain(
    copts = [
        "-Wall",
        "-Werror",
        "-Wconversion",
    ],
    gcc_only_cxxopts = [
        "-Wno-maybe-uninitialized",
    ],
)
```

```python
cc_library(
    name = "cc-lib",
    copts = [ "-Wsign-conversion" ]
    ...
)
```

Some warnings in `-Wall, -Wextra or -pedantic` are, well, too pedantic. Individual warnings can be disabled pre-pending no- to the warning name, e.g. to disable `unused-parameter`:
```python
copts = ["-Wno-unused-parameter"],
```

## Sanitizers

Sanitizers allows detecting certain classes of errors (such as memory or threading issues) at runtime. The typical workflow is:

- First, during compilation, the sanitizer instruments your code to add certain checks
- Then, at runtime, these checks fire if an error is detected, and an error message is printed

The runtime overhead induced by sanitizers is almost always unacceptable for production usage. Therefore, we tend to run sanitized code as part of our CI/CD pipelines (or locally) instead. Therefore sanitizers can only catch issues if we have sufficient unit tests.

Types of Sanitizers

- Address Sanitizer ASan [Docs](https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/AddressSanitizer)
- Thread Sanitizer TSan [Docs](https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki#threadsanitizer)
- Memory Sanitizer MSan [Docs](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/MemorySanitizer.html)
- Undefined Behavior Sanitier UBSan [Docs](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer.html)

See [gcc reference on how to enable sanitizers](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Instrumentation-Options.html). ;tldr - use `-fsanitize=address` for ASan, `-fsanitize=thread` for TSan, and `-fsanitize=undefined` for UBSan.

The IMC Bazel toolchain has first class support for sanitizers, but not all compilers support all sanitizers.

- --features=asan (address) 
- --features=lsan (leak)
- --features=ubsan (undefined behavior)
- --features=cast_san (float cast san)
- --features=divide_by_zero_san

Examples -
```bash
bazel run //engine --features=asan
bazel run //engine --features=lsan
```
